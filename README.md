# agency-ready
An example of learning and using Git, along with drawing objects in Sass.

This project was set up as part of my University degree. I decided to learn git and sass and 
blog the process on my site: www.project-north.co.uk. 

The pants have been built using variables for the waist size, leg lenght, colour etc.

The two pairs I created can be found here: www.project-north.co.uk/agency-ready/index.html
